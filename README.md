# gym_customer_preferences_analysis
This project involved the analysis of gym preferences starting from the responses to a survey we carried out. The total number of interviewees was of 136 gyms users.
The main phases to investigate the preferences consisted in:

1. the creation of a survey with behavioural and endogenous questions;
2. the segmentation of similar users in clusters (Ward);
3. the analysis of the preferences of the cluster (t-test) and the identification of the characteristics of the users (chisq test).
